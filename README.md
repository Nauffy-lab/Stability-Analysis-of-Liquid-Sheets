# Stability-Analysis-of-Liquid-Sheets
As part of an In-Semester Research Project under Prof. Mahesh S. Tirumkudulu at the Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, we developed computational models using MATLAB to analyze the stability of liquid sheets at micron-scale thicknesses under the influence of gas boundary layers. The research focused on understanding the dynamic and viscous interactions governing sheet stability. By formulating and solving complex differential equations, we examined the impact of reduced sheet thickness and viscous gas interactions on stability dynamics through temporal and spatial stability analysis, improving the accuracy of predictive modeling. To visualize key trends, we generated comprehensive plots illustrating stability thresholds and dynamic behavior, offering deeper insights into the intricate interplay of forces affecting liquid sheet stability.
